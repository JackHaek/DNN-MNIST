# DNN-MNIST
My implementation of creating a feed-forward neural network for the MNIST dataset using PyTorch

A couple of things to note:
- You will need to download pytorch from here[https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/] I chose the version with CUDA 11.3 however it doesnt really matter for this project as I did it all on the CPU
- I also included the notebook I created for Jupyter Notebooks
- I will be making a GPU implementation at some point
